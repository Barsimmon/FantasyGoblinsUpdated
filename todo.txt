Reported bugs:
--------------
non-goblins spawning with goblin apparel & weapons - done I think. Apparel & weapons should be restricted to goblin factions because weaponTags were changed
texture bug because of apparel texture for certain body type not existing - done, added apparel for all bodytypes
moonshade soup recipe missing - done
unmined steel turns into squirrel meat if mod is added after start of game - issue with ThingDef hash https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=48267
clothes don't fit females - done, added female bodytype & apparel for all bodytypes
vanilla clothes don't fit goblins. - done, slimmed down goblins
mud pit sounds (JobDriver_PlayBilliards is probably to blame. Possibly has to be extended using C#)

Requested changes (probably won't do in most cases):
----------------------------------------------------
Pretty females (War Chieftain Princess)
CE compatibility or goblin race without items
nerf plumbata
facial stuff compatibility
rotate gibbet
remove clickbait cover art
moonshade inkcap should grow in dark - turned into cave plant
goblin stuff available for non-goblins after researching tech
cannibalism by default? (is by design)

found/caused bugs:
------------------
mud table & wrestling pit madeFromStuff error - done
Moonshade soup rots twice - done
mud production used stone cutting sound - done, changed to foodmaking
mud floor was flammable and turned into burned wood floor (not tested but defs suggested it) - done
door can not be placed over goblin walls (door has tag canPlaceOverWall, which does not work for ThingsDefs that are not vanilla walls. Need C# change?)
naming error - doesn't occur as much, but sometimes fails during pawn generation? Seems to happen when for some reason goblin namer is used on human
wrestling pit icon size - done
make sure humans don't spawn for goblin factions - done
banner & cage size - done
wrestling pit is gathering spot - done
floor does not reach goblin mud walls - need a graphics artist
goblin floors are repetitive - shuffled some things around for wood floor, but need a graphics artist for others
