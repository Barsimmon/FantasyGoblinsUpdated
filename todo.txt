Possible changes:
-----------------
Gibbet cage
sleeping/poison blowdart
nets
poison trap
make goblin stuff goblin only - Buildings, apparel & weapons succeeded
backstories
More skincolours
Split up heads & ears so more combinations are possible
Change map icons
gibbet allow tending/feeding button
gibbet release, recruit etc should work
spike as "shelf" for dead bodies?
See about using 1.1 quest system in some way
See about using 1.1 rank system in some way

Reported bugs:
--------------
non-goblins spawning with goblin apparel & weapons - done I think. Apparel & weapons should be restricted to race and weaponTags were changed
texture bugs (quiver?) - quiver seems to work?
texture bug because of apparel texture for certain body type not existing (maybe fixed now because apparel is restricted to race?)
moonshade soup recipe missing - done
unmined steel turns into squirrel meat if mod is added after start of game - issue with ThingDef hash https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=48267
clothes don't fit females (Bodytype for male & female are both set to "Male". Try to split up bodytypes and adjust apparel textures accordingly?)
vanilla clothes don't fit goblins. Seriously considering using default bodies instead
mud pit sounds (JobDriver_PlayBilliards is probably to blame. Possibly has to be extended using C#)

Requested changes (probably won't do in most cases):
----------------------------------------------------
Pretty females (War Chieftain Princess)
CE compatibility or goblin race without items
nerf plumbata
no aging
epoe patch (shouldn't be needed when humanoid implemented right?)
facial stuff compatibility
rotate gibbet
remove clickbait cover art
moonshade inkcap should grow in dark
goblin stuff available for non-goblins after researching tech
cannibalism by default? (is by design)

found/caused bugs:
------------------
mud table & wrestling pit madeFromStuff error -done
Moonshade soup rots twice - done
mud production used stone cutting sound - done, changed to foodmaking
mud floor was flammable and turned into burned wood floor (not tested but defs suggested it) - done
door can not be placed over goblin walls (door has tag canPlaceOverWall, which does not work for ThingsDefs that are not vanilla walls. Need C# change?)
naming error (ErrorName) - still happening sometimes. Probably when a human pawn is generated for goblin faction for some reason
wrestling pit icon size - done

todo refactoring:
-----------------
fix red errors - done
get rid of all *Base overrides - done
change def syntax so it aligns with core 1.1 - done
check humanoid alien races how to
