backstories
More skincolours
Split up heads & ears so more combinations are possible
Change map icons

Reported bugs:
--------------
non-goblins spawning with goblin apparel & weapons (maybe fixed by restricting apparel to race?)
texture bugs (quiver?) - quiver seems to work?
texture bug because of apparel texture for certain body type not existing (maybe fixed by restricting apparel to race?)
moonshade soup recipe missing
unmined steel turns into squirrel meat if mod is added after start of game
clothes don't fit females (Bodytype for male & female are both set to "Male". Try to split up bodytypes and adjust apparel textures accordingly?)
mud pit sounds (Maybe fix by adding joykind Gaming_Strength? Grunting sounds would be cool but silence is fine too)

Requested changes (probably won't do in most cases):
----------------------------------------------------
Pretty females (War Chieftain Princess)
CE compatibility or goblin race without items
nerf plumbata
no aging
epoe patch (shouldn't be needed when humanoid implemented right?)
facial stuff compatibility
rotate gibbet
remove clickbait cover art
moonshade inkcap should grow in dark
goblin stuff available for non-goblins after researching tech
cannibalism by default? (is by design)

------------------
mud table & wrestling pit madeFromStuff error -done
Moonshade soup rots twice - done
mud production used stone cutting sound - done, changed to foodmaking
mud floor was flammable and turned into burned wood floor (not tested but defs suggested it) - done
