THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE BIOTECH EXPANSION
Honestly. Missing textures, pigskin mixed with goblins have two sets of ears, colors, hair, nothing involving genes works. Don't try to play this mod with Biotech. Will take a while until there is a compatible version.

This mod was first made by Vagabond, I just updated it with retroactive permission.
I did not make any of the art, nor did I do any of the creative thinking. I just fixed some bugs and adjusted some textures.

Original mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1465072243

Let me know if you find any bugs that aren't in the list at the bottom. Suggestions also welcome.

If anyone wants to help, I've got some todo's at the bottom. If you find a fix or want to contribute in another way, tell me about it via Steam, or make a pull request on Github:

Known bugs
----------
- Sometimes humans like the ones generated by the "Wild man wanders in" event get a goblin name and haircut.
- goblin warlord armor for fat or female bodies looks ugly

Original description below
--------------------------

Adds the race of sly and conniving goblins. While physically weak they
more than make up for it with their productivity and intellectual cunning.

Goblins are focused mainly on a tribal playthrough.


REQUIRES

Version 1.0 of the Humanoid Alien Races mod. Made by Erdelf.

FEATURES
--------

Goblins as a playable race.

Goblins are physically weaker with decreased hit points.
They're however faster and have higher rate's of resistance
towards diseases and toxcicity.

Hostile and friendly goblin settlements.

Mud gathering. Mud is a resource that can be harvested from mud pits.
Mud can then be used in the construction of weak mud walls.
While not being
able to suffer much physical abuse they're highly fire resistant.

New Walls.
- Mud walls.
- Wooden palisade.
- Goblin made stone walls.

New Floor Tiles.
- A crude makeshift wooden plank tile.
- Mud floor.
- Goblin made flagstone.

New Weapons.
- An array of neolithic and medieval weapons to equip your
goblin tribe with.

- A few late game guns, if your tribe survives long enough to get out of the
dark ages.

New Armour.
- Equip your goblins in the latest of tribal fashion.
Such as tribal masks, simple leather armours, and warlord armour
for your chieftains.
Warlord armour can only be used by goblins.

New Furniture
- Added more suitable furniture for your goblin tribe.
Such as crude wooden planked tables, stools.
And a variety of decoration and lighting options as well as a
few more things
that I'll hope you'll enjoy in your playthrough.


New Backstories
- I've currently disabled all goblin backstories
for now.
Sorry if this causes any immersion breaking inconveniences.
They currently use the vanilla tribal backstories.



Have fun.

- Change goblin starting gear
